# This workflow has been moved to ci.yml as a job that depends on test-linux
# to optimize cache reuse and ensure tests pass before coverage runs.
# This file is kept for reference but is no longer used.
# 
# The coverage job is now part of the main CI workflow and:
# - Depends on test-linux passing
# - Reuses the build cache from test-linux for faster execution
# - Runs only after tests succeed, avoiding wasted CI time
